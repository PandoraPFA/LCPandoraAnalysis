TAG V00-03 FOR ILCSOFT USAGE
************************************************************************
Added new PandoraPFACalibrator processor, courtesy of A. Lucaci-Timoce.
Added example steering file for PandoraPFACalibrator.
Updated PandoraAnalysis example steering file.
Updated to deal with missing trees more gracefully.
Updated to deal with zombie root files more gracefully.
Included <cstdlib> header to allow use of atoi and atof functions under gcc4.3 onwards.

TAG V00-02 FOR ILCSOFT USAGE
************************************************************************
Divided pfos into those containing tracks, those identified as photons and those remaining as neutral hadrons.
Modified PfoAnalysis processor to writes just a root TTree containing quantities from which all analysis histograms can be recreated.
Moved source for binaries to separate tests directory.
Renamed MCTree to AnalysisMCTree (to avoid conflicts with e.g. identically named header file in MarlinUtil).
Moved calculation of performance figures to analysis helper class.
Modified AnalysePerformance binary, so that it examines only on performance as a function of cos(theta).
Added ReclusterMonitoring binary, which examines performance as a function of energy changes that occur during pandora reclustering.
Added AnalysePerformanceFull binary, which reproduces previous behaviour.
Removed some unnecessary histograms from AnalysePerformanceFull, renamed others.
Altered use of mc neutrino energy so only included in selected histograms; marked with 'nu' or 'A' or used to assess neutral hadron calibration.
Updated standalone Makefile: changed default compiler to g++ and added -O2 optimization flag.

TAG V00-01 FOR ILCSOFT USAGE
************************************************************************
Updated CMake files to use new ILCUTIL package.
Addressed CppCheck (static analysis package) warnings.

************************************************************************
CREATE CLIC_CDR BRANCH
************************************************************************
Added flag to look for quarks with mother. By default, primary quarks are those with no parents (this is not the case for files generated in SLIC environment).
Corrected histogram name, title and axis labels.
Set BUILD_32BIT_COMPATIBLE to OFF by default.
Corrected installation of analysePerformance binary.
Removed streamlog dependency specified for apple plaforms.
Addressed gcc pedantic and extra warning messages. 
Provided a gnu makefile.

************************************************************************
LCD_WG2_VALIDATION_3 TAG
************************************************************************
Improved error checking.
Added missing header file includes, required for gcc 4.4 compilation.
Created pandora analysis package, which brings together a number of marlin processors and simple binaries to analyse particle flow performance.
